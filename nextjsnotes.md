# NEST.js :
    Next.js is a complete framework built on top of React,
    adding server-side rendering, routing, and more,
    while React itself is just a UI library.

# setup :
1. npx create-next-app@latest ./
![alt text](/screenshots/image1.png)

2. enable Tourbopackfilesystemcaching too . 
3. Also install and add reactCompiler:true in  nextconfig.ts 
    (npm install babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest)



# Tips :
    1. no need to import react from "react". (auto done by next)🤝
    2. no more memoization req : next does it itself during build 😎.
        To use Just install : npm install babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
        nextConfig.ts mein do reactCompiler:true

    3. Environment vaiable with preffix : NEXT_PUBLIC_... is accessable client as well as serversite too 
    4. Use Slug for SEO : other wise why using next js , u want your page rank up right.

    1.Tourbo pack file system caching :
        Next.js development builds reload faster by caching
        compiled files on disk instead of rebuilding everything.
    to enable add :

    2. Nextjs also has Forbidden and unauthorized folder : show ui instead error 
    3. **Build Adapters**: next is work as vercel.  
### Simple meaning:
A **build adapter** tells Next.js **where and how your app will run after build**.

👉 Next.js builds your app once, but different platforms run apps differently.

So adapter = **translator between Next.js build and hosting platform**.

# Lesson 1  : Sever Component (SSR and CSR)
***Advantage*** :
    1. Component render on server and pre rendered html output  sent to client.
    2. Direct access serversite Resources ( Database,Filesystem,security)
    3. Better SEO because content comes ready from server.
    4. Smaller JS bundle will sent to client → better performance.
***Limitation*** :
    1. cannot use (states,useEffects), browser event (onclick...).
    2. No direct access to browser APIs (window, localStorage).
***
# Lesson 2 : Client Side Rendering (CSR / Client Component)

***To Use*** :
    1. Write `"use client"` at the top of the component.

***Advantage*** :
    1. Supports state, effects and browser events (onClick, onChange).
    2. Enables interactive and dynamic UI in browser.

***Limitation*** :
    1. Larger JS bundle sent to client → slower initial load.
    2. Data fetching happens after page load → weaker SEO compared to SSR.

# Lesson 3 : Routes 
    1. every folder in app is a route 
    2. And every route has a page.tsx file which is the entry point of that route
![alt text](/screenshots/image4.png)

    3. Nested Routes : yes u can make multiple folder/routes in one folder.
---
# Lesson 4 : Dynamic Route : 

    1. Based on user input or any specific date routes change aka link address
![alt text](/screenshots/image5.png)

***How to do***
    1. warp the changing part in [ ]

# Lesson 5 : Layout.tsx 
    1. it is global layout : what ever u add here will reflect to all pages.
![alt text](/screenshots/imageCorrect sentence:

✅ “Sorry, I was having lunch, that’s why I wasn’t able to reply.7.png)
    2. We can create a Layout.tsx for any specific folder/route 
      so that ui be can share accrose all its children

    4. You can create a folder that dont show in URL : But Why? 
    
![alt text](/screenshots/image8.png)

***Answer:***
    Now u can create very seperate layout.tsx for any route/folder so thatroot layout dont affect them.

    5. Obviously u cant : create 2 page.tsx , in one folder 
        Dont get confused with : (folders) they wont be contribute in url 

    6. Creating 2 page.tsx give error     
![alt text](/screenshots/image9.png)

# Lesson 6 : Error Handaling (error.js)
    1. Nextjs has -> Error.js file that catches error and display them in UI.
    2. Nearest Error.js trigger to the error page.

# Lesson 7 : Data Fetching 
Ref:https://youtu.be/I1V9YWqRIeI?t=2590
**There are so many ways:**
1. Traditional way 
![alt text](/screenshots/image11.png)

2. ServerSite Fetching : Faster , efficient ,clean code,Improve intial load time.
### Client Side Fetching
- Page first loads in browser.
- User may see loading state initially.
- API call happens in the client after render.
- Content appears after data is fetched.
- Data comes **after FCP (First Contentful Paint)**.

### Server Side Fetching
- API call happens on the server before sending HTML.
- Data is already fetched during rendering.
- Client receives ready-to-render UI.
- Content is visible at or near FCP.
- **Better SEO** : preload page has more content to crawl.
- **Request Deduplication** : avoid multiple fetch , api call. even u write multiple line first time happen and next from cached it reuse promise.
- **Security** : api keys remains in server no need to expose in client site .
- **Parallel Fetching**: multiple data requests run simultaneously on the server, avoiding network waterfall and reducing total loading time.

## ✅ Why UI did not update (HMR + Server Fetch Cache)

**Flow:**

1. Page loads → data is fetched from the API.
2. Next.js stores this result in the **Server Component HMR cache** (development only).
3. You change the code.
4. HMR (Hot Module Replacement) updates the code without full page reload ✅
5. Fetch is **not executed again** because cached data is reused ❌
6. UI looks unchanged since the same cached data is rendered.

> HMR is working correctly — the data remains the same due to caching, not because refresh failed.

# Lesson 8:  How we'll start Backend in Nextjs

    1. There is no need to setup , manage , active server manually . 
    2. setup is as same as frontend we did. 
    3. Just folder structre does that all .

# Lesson 9 : Caching 
**Storing data Temporary , to reuse data and avoid Rebuilt/Refetched.**


    1. caching get reworked in Next 16.
    2. We have multipel layers of cache.
![2026-02-14-18-16-30.png](./screenshots/2026-02-14-18-16-30.png)
    3. Next js Brings : 'Use Cache' Directive 
    4. Use to Cache pages,components and functions. 15min is default to tune/configure cacheing (cacheLife("hours") = how long data's state  cached)
    ![2026-02-14-18-23-29.png](./screenshots/2026-02-14-18-23-29.png)
    5. How to Enable it. yes it is not enabled by default.
    ![2026-02-14-18-22-22.png](./screenshots/2026-02-14-18-22-22.png)

    6. To clear the cache on cmd. 
![2026-02-14-18-26-00.png](./screenshots/2026-02-14-18-26-00.png)

## PPR: Partial Pre-Rendering
- Only some parts of the page are pre-rendered at build time, others load on demand.
- Makes first load fast, but still gets fresh data when needed.
- Good for pages with both static and dynamic content.
- Next.js decides what to pre-render and what to fetch later, so you get best of both: speed + up-to-date info.

**Note:** If cache component is enabled, you don't need to set up PPR—Next.js handles it for you automatically.

# Lesson 10 : Server Actions and Mutations

![2026-02-23-12-11-06.png](./screenshots/2026-02-23-12-11-06.png)

## What it is?
Asynchronous functions that run **only on the server** to handle form submissions and data mutations securely without creating separate API routes.

## How to use?

**1. Create Server Action:**
```tsx
// app/actions/bookEvent.ts
'use server'

export async function bookEvent(formData: FormData) {
    const email = formData.get('email') as string;
    await db.bookings.create({ data: { email } });
    revalidatePath('/events'); // Clear cache
    return { success: true };
}
```

**2. Use in Form (Client Component):**
```tsx
'use client'
import { bookEvent } from '@/app/actions/bookEvent';

export default function BookingForm() {
    return (
        <form action={bookEvent}>
            <input name="email" type="email" required />
            <button type="submit">Book Event</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

**3. With Loading State:**
```tsx
'use client'
import { useTransition } from 'react';

export default function BookingForm() {
    const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
    
    const handleSubmit = async (formData: FormData) => {
        startTransition(async () => {
            await bookEvent(formData);
        });
    };
    
    return (
        <form action={handleSubmit}>
            <input name="email" type="email" required />
            <button disabled={isPending}>
                {isPending ? 'Booking...' : 'Book Event'}
            </button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

## What it provides?

✅ **Security** - Runs on server, API keys stay safe  
✅ **Simpler Code** - No `/api` routes needed  
✅ **Better Performance** - Smaller client JS bundle  
✅ **Progressive Enhancement** - Works without JavaScript  
✅ **Auto Caching** - Use `revalidatePath()` to update cached data  
✅ **Error Handling** - Return errors safely to client  

**vs API Routes:**
- Server Actions: Inside components, direct function calls, progressive enhancement
- API Routes: Separate files, `fetch()` calls, complex logic/webhooks

# Lesson 11: Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Next.js is great for SEO. You can add meta tags and other SEO info in two main ways:

## 1. Config-based Metadata (Recommended)
- Add a `metadata` object in your `layout.js` or `page.js`.
- Next.js auto-generates the right meta tags in your HTML.
- You can set unique meta for each route, or use a default for all pages.
- Dynamic meta (changes per page/user) is also possible.

## 2. File-based Metadata
- Just add files like `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, or `sitemap.xml` in the app folder.
- Next.js will use these files automatically.
- File-based meta can **override config-based** meta if both exist.

# Errors You Might Face

### 1. Mongoose Document vs Plain JS Object

**Problem:**  
Mongoose queries (like `findOne`, `find`) return Mongoose documents, not plain JavaScript objects.  
If you try to use JS methods or serialize them (e.g., send to client), you may get errors or unexpected results.

**Fix:**  
Use `.lean()` at the end of your query to get plain JS objects.

```js
// ❌ Problematic (returns Mongoose docs)
const event = await Event.findOne({ slug });
const similar = await Event.find({ tags: { $in: event.tags } });

// ✅ Correct (returns plain objects)
const event = await Event.findOne({ slug }).lean();
const similar = await Event.find({ tags: { $in: event.tags } }).lean();
```

**Why:**  
Plain objects are safer for serialization, spreading, and passing to client components in Next.js.
